<p align="center">I'm mostly involved with PowerShell and GoLang generating tooling to make life a little bit easier. I have a slight obsession with configuring my <a href="https://github.com/Printoiid/Mournhold/tree/main/SofleKM/Lizardbutt">QMK keyboard</a> and my <a href="https://github.com/Printoiid/Mournhold/tree/main/nvim">Neovim setup.</a> On the side, I enjoy 3D modeling/printing, as well as Roguelike and RTS games.</p>
